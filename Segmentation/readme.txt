The sample processing code requires the original captured represented in binary files (.bin), as well as the RGB images as converted by the Phase One Image SDK.
These files have not been uploaded, as the file sizes are too large. 
However, the outputs of the processing pipeline, in the form of original RAW and RGB images, have been uploaded in the 'Dataset' directory, 
so the output of this script can be seen.
